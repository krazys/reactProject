## About
This repository contains a collection of React practice projects that I have built. The projects are a mix of simple and complex, and they cover a variety of topics, such as routing, state management, and data fetching.

The projects are intended to be used as a way to learn React and to practice my skills. 

## Projects
- [Project 1](./calculator): A simple calculator app that allows users to perform basic calculations.
- [Project 2](./snapShot_Router/snapshot): A Gallery app that fetches images from Flickr based on user search data & uses react-router-dom for routing between different pages.
