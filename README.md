About
This repository contains a collection of React practice projects that I have built. The projects are a mix of simple and complex, and they cover a variety of topics, such as routing, state management, and data fetching.

The projects are intended to be used as a way to learn React and to practice my skills. I hope that they will be helpful to other developers who are learning React or who are looking for some inspiration.# reactProject
